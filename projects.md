### 🌆 Spatio-Temporal Study of Sustainable Urban Morphology (SUM)

**Study Area:** Mecklenburg County, North Carolina  
**Temporal Coverage:** 1990–2023  
**Scale:** Parcel-, street-, and neighborhood-level analysis

</div>

---

### 🔍 Research Problem

Urban sustainability is often evaluated using **cross-sectional indicators**, providing limited insight into how urban form evolves over time. This project addresses a core gap in urban analytics: the lack of **longitudinal, spatially explicit frameworks** for measuring sustainable urban morphology.

---

### 🧠 Research Contributions

This dissertation develops a **spatio-temporal analytical framework** that:

- Quantifies urban form using reproducible morphology indicators  
- Tracks long-run structural change in the built environment  
- Detects spatial heterogeneity and regime shifts in urban development  
- Integrates time-series, clustering, and spatial statistics  

The framework enables fine-grained evaluation of **whether**, **where**, and **how** urban morphology trends toward (or away from) sustainability.

<div class="callout">

**Core Contribution:**  
Rather than treating urban form as static, this research models the built environment as a dynamic, spatially heterogeneous system with measurable temporal trajectories.

### 🧪 Data & Methods

**Data Sources:**
- Tax parcels and building records  
- Street networks and intersection topology  
- Administrative and GIS boundary datasets  

**Methods:**
- Urban morphology metrics (density, compactness, street hierarchy)  
- Spatial–temporal clustering (ST-DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)  
- Kernel density estimation (KDE)  
- Time-series trend analysis and structural break detection  
- Spatial regression and exploratory spatial data analysis  

---

### ⚙️ Technical Stack

- **Programming:** Python, R  
- **GIS:** ArcGIS Pro, GeoPandas, PostGIS  
- **Analytics:** Spatial statistics, time-series modeling, clustering  
- **Infrastructure:** High-performance computing (HPC), automated pipelines  

---

### 📊 Key Outcomes

- Longitudinal evidence of heterogeneous urban form trajectories  
- Identification of spatial regimes with distinct sustainability dynamics  
- A scalable methodology applicable to other U.S. metropolitan regions  

---

### 🏛️ Policy & Planning Relevance

This research supports **data-driven urban governance** by providing:

- Objective diagnostics for long-term land-use outcomes  
- Evidence-based inputs for planning and infrastructure decisions  
- A foundation for automating sustainability monitoring in local governments  

<div class="callout">

**Governance Insight:**  
The framework enables continuous, automated monitoring of urban sustainability indicators, supporting proactive planning rather than reactive assessment.
