### Urban Data Science · Geospatial Analytics · Policy Automation

I am a final-year **Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy Analysis** specializing in **geospatial data science**, **urban systems modeling**, and **AI-driven automation of local government workflows**.

My research focuses on developing **quantitative, scalable, and reproducible methods** to analyze urban form, infrastructure, and governance using spatial–temporal data. I work at the intersection of urban planning, data science, and public policy, with an emphasis on translating advanced analytics into practical decision-support tools for cities and public agencies.

### Research & Technical Focus
- Sustainable urban morphology and long-term spatial change
- Spatial–temporal modeling and clustering
- Street networks, land use, and built-environment analytics
- GeoAI and machine learning for urban systems
- Automation of zoning, permitting, and planning workflows

### Tools & Methods
Python · R · ArcGIS Pro · PostGIS · GeoPandas · OSMNX · NetworkX · HPC · Google Earth Engine
