title: About
---

I am a final-year PhD candidate in **Public Policy Analysis** with a specialization in **geospatial data science**, **urban systems modeling**, and **spatial–temporal analytics**.

My research focuses on developing **quantitative, scalable methods** to understand how urban form, infrastructure, and policy interact over time. I work at the intersection of urban planning, data science, and public policy, with an emphasis on **automation, reproducibility, and decision-support systems** for local and regional governments.

My academic background integrates:
- Advanced spatial statistics and econometrics  
- Large-scale geospatial data engineering  
- Machine learning and GeoAI applications  
- Urban morphology and sustainability analysis  

Across my projects, I design end-to-end analytical pipelines—from raw administrative and spatial data to interpretable models and policy-relevant insights. My work routinely combines **Python, R, GIS platforms, HPC environments, and open-source spatial libraries**.

My long-term research agenda centers on **modernizing local government workflows** through data-driven automation, particularly in land management, infrastructure planning, and urban analytics. I aim to produce research that is both methodologically rigorous and directly applicable to real-world governance challenges.
