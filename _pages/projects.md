### 🔍 Research Problem


Urban sustainability is often evaluated using **cross‑sectional indicators**, providing limited insight into how urban form evolves over time. This project addresses a core gap in urban analytics: the lack of **longitudinal, spatially explicit frameworks** for measuring sustainable urban morphology.


---


### 🧠 Research Contributions


This dissertation develops a **spatio‑temporal analytical framework** that:
- Quantifies urban form using reproducible morphology indicators
- Tracks long‑run structural change in the built environment
- Detects spatial heterogeneity and regime shifts in urban development
- Integrates time‑series, clustering, and spatial statistics


The framework enables fine‑grained evaluation of **whether**, **where**, and **how** urban morphology trends toward (or away from) sustainability.

**Methods:**
- Urban morphology metrics (density, compactness, street hierarchy)
- Spatial–temporal clustering (ST‑DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)
- Kernel density estimation (KDE)
- Time‑series trend analysis and structural break detection
- Spatial regression and exploratory spatial data analysis
